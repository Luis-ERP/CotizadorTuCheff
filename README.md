Complex price quote generator using Python and PyQT5, a technology to create GUI interfaces. 
Thist is the most complex project I've done.I actually recently remade this project so it 
could be more efficient and applied knowledge I've gathered working with Android apps with
Android Studio. 

Here was of extreme importance the structure of project, as I had python files for UI/UIX 
interface, the logic scripts, and the databases connections. Because of it's complexity, 
I had to borrow the concept of MVC from web development.

For databases, as the client wanted the information to be accessible from different devices,
I integrated a real time database of Firebase, a storage service provided by Google. I did like
it, since it was a not relational database, I had the freedom to manage data more efficient,
otherwise I couldn't have done it with SQL.
